                  <p class="card-text">During my second year of college, I found myself overwhelmed with coursework, extracurricular activities, and a part-time job. I was sleeping only 4-5 hours a night and constantly felt anxious about falling behind. Eventually, I started experiencing panic attacks before exams.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">The turning point came when a professor noticed my exhaustion and suggested I visit the university counseling center. At first, I was hesitant – I thought seeking help meant I was failing somehow. But it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">Through counseling, I learned practical stress management techniques and how to set realistic expectations for myself. I also learned to recognize the early warning signs of burnout. Most importantly, I realized I wasn't alone – many students were facing similar challenges.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">Today, I maintain a much healthier balance. I practice mindfulness daily, prioritize sleep, and have become more selective about my commitments. My grades have actually improved, and I enjoy my college experience much more.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">I always dreaded class presentations. Just thinking about standing in front of my peers would make my heart race and my palms sweat. I would stay up all night rehearsing, but when the moment came, my mind would go blank. This anxiety started affecting other areas of my life – I avoided study groups and social events, which left me feeling isolated.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">After reading about social anxiety on this website, I realized what I was experiencing had a name, and there were strategies to manage it. I started with small steps – asking one question in class each week, then gradually working up to larger contributions.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">I also tried the breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation techniques from the Self-Help Tools section. Before presentations, I would do a 5-minute breathing exercise to calm my nervous system.</p>
                  
                  <p class="card-text">It wasn't an overnight transformation, but after a semester of consistent practice, I noticed significant improvement. Recently, I gave a 15-minute presentation and actually enjoyed sharing my research with the class. I still get nervous, but now I have tools to manage those feelings.</p>

              <p class="card-text">During my junior year, I experienced a period of depression that made even simple tasks feel impossible. Getting out of bed, attending classes, completing assignments – everything required enormous effort. I started falling behind, which only made me feel worse about myself.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text">For months, I tried to push through on my own, thinking it was just a phase or that I needed to "toughen up." But eventually, I confided in a friend who encouraged me to talk to someone at the university counseling center.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text">The counselor helped me understand that depression is a medical condition, not a personal failing. With a combination of therapy, lifestyle changes, and support from friends, I gradually started to feel better. I learned to recognize negative thought patterns and challenge them.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text">An important part of my recovery was connecting with a student support group, where I met others with similar experiences. Hearing their stories helped me feel less alone and gave me hope that things could get better.</p>
              
              <p class="card-text">Today, I still have challenging days, but I've developed a toolkit of strategies that help me manage my mental health. I've also become an advocate for mental health awareness on campus.</p>
